  <h1>Automation</h1>
    <p>Automation. In recent years, the idea has brought fear, worry and panic. Popular culture time and time again paints a dreary, dark image of the future in which Man is replaced by machine and left to be without use and powerless. However, this hypothetical future isn't as realistic as one might think. Automation has the capacity to provide us with countless opportunities. In fact, automation is already around us and has been for longer than you'd think.</p>

  <div class="image image8" id='history'></div>
  <div class = "section">
  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>Automation is getting machines to do tasks that are tedious, difficult or even impossible for humans alone. The term automation was coined by the automobile industry in the 1940s to describe the rapidly increasing use of automatic devices on assembly lines.<br><br></p>
  
  <p>There are early uses of automation include the waterwheel developed in the 11th century to convert the kinetic energy of falling or flowing water into a more useful to do tasks like milling. Other historical uses include the lathe, appearing as early as the 13th century BC with significant improvements to the design being made in the 18th century AD, and the rapid increase in automated factory production during World War 2.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image image6" id='examples'></div>
  <div class = "section">
  <h3>Some Examples</h3>
  <p>Clearly, automation isn't just science fiction. It has been with us for millennia and is currently all around us, more than ever before. In our homes, on our streets, in factories and at work, it is inescapable.<br><br></p>
  
  <p>Automation can be seen in "smart" homes with temperature sensors that are given control of heating or fridges that keep record of what's running out and orders the required groceries. There are also hoovers that can navigate around a house and find areas in need of cleaning and home security systems that notify the homeowner when someone approaches the door.<br><br></p>
  
  <p>From self-service checkouts in supermarkets to self-driving cars, many tasks are now being automated for the ease of mankind. Automated devices are used on factory assembly lines, in operating systems in computers to automatically repair broken files and in offices to do the job of a secretary.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image image5" id='future'></div>
  <div class = "section">
  <h3>The Future</h3>
  <p>So, where will automation take us? Well, anywhere, with robots on mars not even the sky is the limit. Fears of humans becoming obsolete still float around the news, but what is more likely is freedom for humans to carry out higher level tasks. Before the use of heavy machinery in agriculture, more people were farmers. While it is true that there are fewer farmers several new jobs that didn't previously exist have been created to facilitate the introduction of automation in many industries.<br><br></p> 
  
  <p>While there shouldn't be panic or fear for the future, there are a few questions or concerns. When life or death decisions are put in the "hands" of a prewritten algorithm, who is at fault for the the consequences? Who decides how artificial intelligence should handle ethics? What is the end goal of automation? Surely a point will arise at which nothing is done by human effort alone? How will that feel? Only time will tell.
